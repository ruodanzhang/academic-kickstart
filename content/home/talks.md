Outside of research, dance is my number-one passion. I am a classically trained dancer, and began dancing since I was four years old. I received a majority of my dance training in Ningbo, China. In Bloomington, I have performed with MotionArts Dance Academy (Ballet) and IU African American Dance Company (Contemporary). I also enjoy Chinese Ethnic and Folk Dances, Ballroom/Latin Dance, Jazz, Swing, Salsa, and Bachata. 

I began riding in 2016, and I have been training in English riding (dressage and show jumping). As a new member of the US Equestrian Federation, I hope to appear in the show ring soon.
